# FB-Hackathon-2017

We introduce you Edi..the Best Bot!!! It is a useful tool that let's you interact with you friends and although its main use case is to help a group of people decide upon a favourable music playlist for an event such as a party it can be extended to other problems. It comes as a solution to the lack of chatbot functionality of Facebook groups, providing fast communication between users thus increasing productivity. Let's see a demo of how it works.
- the users have to connect separately to the chat bot
- a user can do that by simply typing "hello" in the chat box
- then someone creates a poll and invites the other users
- any member of the poll can suggest new songs by simply typing the track and / or the song name - an API will connect to Spotify database and match the given input to a song
- the other users can approve or disapprove them and see a live ranking of votes of the songs 
- all signed up users get alerted when a new song is added
- there will be an option that exports the songs to a playlist on Spotify when the users have decided what songs they would like to keep
